## Graph

Collection of Vertices and Edges. Nodes are called vertices and linkages connecting two nodes are called edges.

G = (V, E)


| Term                   | Definition                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directed Graph         | Edges have direction                                                          |
| Undirected Graph       | Edges do not have direction                                                   |
| Self Loop              | Edge connecting the vertex to itself                                          |
| Parallel Edges         | Edges between same two nodes but opposite direction                           |
| Adjacent Vertices      | Two vertices connected by an edge                                             |
| Simple Digraph         | Without Self Loop and Parallel Edges                                          |
| Degree of Vertice      | No. of outgoing edges                                                         |
| Non Connected          | Have two or more sets of unconnected vertices                                 |
| Strongly Connected     | From any vertex we can reach all other vertices via multiple edges            |
| Path                   | Set of vertices which connect a pair of vertices                              |
| Directed Acyclic Graph | Directed graph which has no cylces                                            |
| Topological Sort       | DAG vertices can be arranged in a linear manner with edges only going forward |
| Cut-Edge               |                                                                               |
| Back-Edge              |                                                                               |
